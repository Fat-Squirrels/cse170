            Many students struggle with developing good study habits and completing their assignments due to a lack of adequate support and resources. Often, students find themselves overwhelmed by the volume of work and the complexity of the subjects they are studying. Without proper guidance, they may adopt inefficient study methods, leading to poor academic performance and increased stress. Additionally, the transition from high school to college or university introduces a higher level of academic rigor, which can be challenging to manage without the right tools and support systems in place.
